Build Tool (Maven)

Build tool automates the process of compiling the code (.java -> .class) ,
packaging to Jar/war/ear, running unit test cases and managing dependencies.

We have 3 build tools available = maven, gradle, ant

JDK = JRE + Compiler
JRE = JVM
JVM = Interpreter

rt.jar has been provided along with JDK -> java.lang, java.util, java.io, java.math

Calculator - Addition, multiplication , division , etc.

Can we export the data to excel file (Microsoft). Apache poi

20 java file  -> 20 class file -> we zip it to Jar file
2000 java file -> 2000 class file -> we zip it to jar file
4000 java file -> 4000 class file -> we zip it to jar file


JAR -> Java Archive (Java file + jar) -> reusable to some other project
WAR -> Web Archive / Web Application Archive (Java + HTML + CSS + JS + jar) -> we deploy it to web server (tomcat)
EAR -> Enterprise archive -> Multiple Module (multiple Jar + War file) -> we deploy to application server (JBOSS/Weblogic)

Maven
———-
Maven is a build tool which helps to build java projects.

Features of maven ->

1. Dependency management
2. Build lifecycle
3. plugin
4. pom.xml (Project Object Model) - it is the main configuration file that we provide to a project. Where we mention about project configuration, dependency management and plugin

Maintain a project directory

project_name
		— src
			— main
					— java (java source code)
					— resource (resource file like properties file)
			— test
					— java (test code)
		— pom.xml
---------------------------------------------
pom.xml -
    Heart of maven project, contains all the information of domain, group,
    project management, dependency management and plugin.

    groupId - provide domain name of the organization for
              which we are creating the project. And make it unique
              from other organization project.
    artifactId - Is the name of project. under same group id we can have
                multiple but unique artifact or project id
    version - which maintain project version.

    ** SNAPSHOT will never create a new version it will always overwrite the
    existing jar file. But if we have version mentioned that needs to be changed
    while rebuilding.

    FirstMaven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    FirstMaven-1.0.jar
    FirstMaven-2.0.jar
---------------------------------------------
dependency Management:
---------------------
dependency on the external library of your project. apache poi
---------------------
3 types of repository for maven:
--------------------------------
1. Central - https://mvnrepository.com
2. Local - .m2 folder under your local user
3. Remote - which is located in organizations remote location

Any new dependency been added:
1. first ity will search in local repo(.m2)
2. if not found in local then go to central (https://mvnrepository.com)
3. if not found in central then go to remote.

** .m2 folder(local repo) where library can be store life
-long time unless we are removing manually.

--------------------------------
Maven Build Lifecycle:
---------------------
1. Clean - standard lifecycle, where we are cleaning the existing
           packages and build. This works on the project level.
           Local repo (.m2) folder level this does not work.
2. validate - scan the entire project and validate the project
            information is accurate or not.
3. compile - where source code compiled and .class file get created.
4. test - Run unit test cases of the project.
5. package - This step helps to package the jar/war/ear file
6. verify - verify whether the criteria for maven has met.
7. install = (validate + compile + test + package + verify)
        along with it will help to publish to local (.m2) repo.
8. site - where project documentation, matrics
        and report get created. (code coverage with
        jcoco plugin/sonarqube)
9. deploy - copy the final jar file to the remote location
        and deploy to server.

----------------------------------------------
build profile: help us to segregate the different environment that
    we need to work on. And we can perform operation based on the profile.
----------------------------------------------
plugins:
it helps to perform all the required task that maven does perform.

1. Build Plugin - Clean, compiler, deploy, install, jar, resource, site, surefire
2. Report plugin - jcoco plugin/ sonerqube
